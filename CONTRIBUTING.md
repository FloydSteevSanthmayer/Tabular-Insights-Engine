# Contributing

Thank you for considering contributing. Please follow these guidelines:

- Fork the repository and create feature branches (`git checkout -b feature/my-feature`).
- Keep changes small and focused; open a PR against `main` when ready.
- Run tests locally: `pytest -q`.
- Ensure code is formatted with `black` (pre-commit will enforce this).
- For major changes, open an issue describing the problem and proposed approach.
